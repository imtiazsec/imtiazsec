### I'm 20 years old, Security Enthusiast and Bug bounty Hunter from Bangladesh :bangladesh:
I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and domains 💡. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems ✨. Apart from that I also love to guide and mentor newbies 👨🏻‍💻. I like to use a variety of useful computer software & making scripts in bash to automate processes. I also like watching anime, and gaming. I used to dream of being a gamer. But the reality made me have to learn a technology and I also came into contact with Hacking 💻. Although I was not interested in it at the beginning, luckily I slowly fell in love with it :heart:.
